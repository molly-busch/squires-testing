## About the Collection

  Th3 collection consists of digitized posters for performances that took place on Virginia Techâ€™s campus. The collection is not limited to student and school productions, but also posters for regional performing arts groups that visited the campus. 
  
  The cataloging team sought to make the posters searchable by event type, group, and graphical description of the posters. Originally the posters were digitized with limited guidance from collection owner and the digiitization team onlu included information as shown on poster. There is incomplete information for many posters, and the collection does not include contextual information about the performances. The application profile attempts to cover all information that may conceivably be available for a given poster, however the expectation is that many of the elements may not be known. 
  
  The application profile developed for this collection is intended to describe the text and graphical content of the poster, rather than details regarding the performance being advertised. Please see document below for reference.
