## About the Collection

  This collection consists of digitized posters for performances that took place at Squires Theatre and other locations on Virginia Techâ€™s campus. The collection is not limited to student productions and includes posters for other regional performing arts organizations. There is incomplete information for many posters, and the collection does not include contextual information about the performances. The application profile attempts to cover all information that may conceivably be available for a given poster, however the expectation is that many of the elements may not be known. This application profile is intended to describe the text and graphical content of the poster, rather than details regarding the performance being advertised.



This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
