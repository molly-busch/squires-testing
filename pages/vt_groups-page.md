## Virginia Tech Performing Groups
This page contains information about Virignia Tech current and past musical performing groups that started at the university. 

## The University Jazz Ensemble
  In the colection we have four posters for [Virginia Tech's group Jazz Ensembles](https://sopa.vt.edu/future-students/undergraduate-programs/Music/music-ensembles/jazz-ensembles.html). On the posters you wil see they are referred to as the University Jazz Ensemble and have featured notable jazz artists who have performed or lectured classes at Virginia Tech. The group primarily performs big band literature, past and contemporary, and will showcase new works from modern composers.

  They can be listened to on [Sound Cloud](https://soundcloud.com/vtjazz).
